Messing around with Java

Telemnar was King of Gondor during the Great Plague, and died of the disease. His nephew Tarondor succeeded him while still very young, and became the longest-reigning King of Gondor. This is exactly the kind of thing that happens in Crusader Kings 2.
Anyway I am doing the github tutorial.
